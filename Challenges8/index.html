<h1 class="white-text daniel-text-spacing">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
in the company I joined. I<br> honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h1>
<p class="paragraph-colors">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

<h1 class="kira-for-margin">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h1>
<p class="kira-jean-paragraph-color kira-paragraph-text">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>

<h1 class="white-text">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
learning from their experiences was easy.</h1>
<p class="paragraph-colors">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>
